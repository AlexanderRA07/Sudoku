How To Run:
Open Mars simulator in the src directory.
Make sure the simulator is set to 'Assemble all files in directory' which is a feature found in the Settings tab
Assemble and run main.asm

The main.asm will be the core of the project, and will be the file that is run to play the game.
Other files will be stored in modular directories

Each Contributor stores their specific .asm contributions in their own named directory within /modules
Within their named directory, a readme.txt is provided for the contributor to describe and catalogue his or her work
